The better part of valour is discretion. Harp not on that.  The course of true love never did run smooth.  Hisperia, the Princess' gentlewoman, Confesses that she secretly o'erheard Your daughter and her cousin much commend The parts and graces of the wrestler That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles; And she believes, wherever they are gone, That youth is surely in their company. Come, sing; and you that will not, hold your tongues.  A fool, a fool! I met a fool i' th' forest, A motley fool.  Here comes my sister, reading; stand aside.

It was Greek to me.  No, [Corin](https://www.google.com), being old, thou canst not guess, Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover As ever sigh'd upon a midnight pillow.   But doth he know that I am in this forest, and in man's apparel? Looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled?

> My Dad says that being a *Londoner* has nothing to do with where you’re born.  
> He says that there are people who get off a jumbo jet at *Heathrow*, go through immigration waving any kind of passport, hop on the tube and by the time the train’s pulled into *Piccadilly Circus*, they’ve become a Londoner.


As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns, and, as thou say'st, charged my brother, on his blessing, to breed me well; and there begins my sadness.  No, hath not? Rosalind lacks, then, the love Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one. And I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death anew: but I must attend his majesty's command, to  whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection. 

My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and report speaks goldenly of his profit.  This is it, Adam, that grieves me; and the spirit of my father, which I think is within me, begins to mutiny against this servitude.  To hide us from pursuit that will be made After my flight. To-day my Lord of Amiens and myself Did steal behind him as he lay along Under an oak whose antique root peeps out Upon the brook that brawls along this wood!  To the which place a poor sequest'red stag, That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt, Did come to languish; and, indeed, my lord, The wretched animal heav'd forth such groans That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat Almost to bursting; and the big round tears Cours'd one another down his innocent nose In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool, Much marked of the melancholy Jaques, Stood on th' extremest verge of the swift brook, Augmenting it with tears. It will make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques. Peace, you dull fool! I found them on a tree.

Brevity is the soul of wit.  That's meat and drink to me, now.  Good mother, fetch my bail. Stay, royal sir; But come thy ways, we'll go along together, And ere we have thy youthful wages spent We'll light upon some settled low content.` Why, how now, monsieur! what a life is this, That your poor friends must woo your company?  What, you look merrily! Not see him since! Sir, sir, that cannot be.  B Wilt thou rest damn'd? God help thee, shallow man! God make incision in thee! thou art raw. Sir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get that I wear; owe no man hate, envy no man's happiness; glad of other men's good, content with my harm; and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck. You have said; but whether wisely or no, let the forest judge.

Harp not on that.  He'll go along o'er the wide world with me; Leave me alone to woo him.  Why, how now, monsieur! what a life is this, That your poor friends must woo your company?  What, you look merrily! And then the justice, In fair round belly with good capon lin'd, With eyes severe and beard of formal cut, Full of wise saws and modern instances; And so he plays his part. 

I must be cruel only to be kind.  He lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a brother, and as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my education.  Thou art thy father's daughter; there's enough. But if thy love were ever like to mine, As sure I think did never man love so, How many actions most ridiculous Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy? But look to it: Find out thy brother wheresoe'er he is; Seek him with candle; bring him dead or living Within this twelvemonth, or turn thou no more To seek a living in our territory.

The game is up.  That's meat and drink to me, now.  I will wear my heart upon my sleeve  But for this lord Who hath abus'd me as he knows himself, Though yet he never harm'd me, here I quit him. It is my only suit, Provided that you weed your better judgments Of all opinion that grows rank in them That I am wise.  As it is a spare life, look you, it fits my humour well; but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much against my stomach. 

That's meat and drink to me, now.  Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch Of the rang'd empire fall! Here is my space.  Kingdoms are clay;  For my part, he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my birth that differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses are bred better; for, besides that they are fair with their feeding, they are taught their manage, and to that end riders dearly hir'd; but I, his brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him as I.  Your brother- no, no brother; yet the son- Yet not the son; I will not call him son Of him I was about to call his father- Hath heard your praises; and this night he means To burn the lodging where you use to lie, And you within it.  But if thy love were ever like to mine, As sure I think did never man love so, How many actions most ridiculous Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy? I think he be transform'd into a beast; For I can nowhere find him like a man.
